Original Description

These are scrapers for the site Board Game Geek. Each serves a distinct purpose in data collection. 

Because ID assignments are not intuitive (at least to me) for games, in order to get game details you have to know the ID beforehand. With clever scraping of BGG's board game section, you can get game IDs for all board games on the site along with basic rating information. If you so desire, you can then use the extracted IDs to get information on all of the different games on the site. 

Use scrapy to first run spider.py with scrapy runspider spider.py -o items.csv. This CSV will contain game names, IDs, and ratings. Next, run python extract_ids.py to put all of the IDs into a file called ids.txt. This file is then used by the last script. Run python get_game_info.py to retrieve all games whose IDs are in ids.txt. This data will be written to a CSV called games.csv and is much more detailed than the information contained in items.csv. Note that there are 80000+ games, so each of these steps will take some time. To be nice to the site, a request is made for 30 games at a time and is only made once every 2 seconds. In the forums the operator mentions 2 requests per second is fine, but just to be safe I only do 1 every 2 seconds.

I tried to predict Average Rating of a Game vs all other relevant variables.

here, I used 
Numpy
Pandas
Seaborn 
Matplotlib
sklearn

I performed Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression and Regression with Neural networks for predictions on google CoLab.
